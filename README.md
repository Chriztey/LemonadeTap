Before you begin
In this pathway, you learned how to add a button to an app and how to modify the app to respond to a button click. Now, it's time to practice what you learned by building an app.

You will create an app called the Lemonade app. First, read the requirements of the Lemonade app to understand how the app should look and behave. If you want to challenge yourself, you can build the app on your own from there. If you get stuck, you can read subsequent sections to receive more hints and guidance about how to break down the problem and approach it step by step.

Work through this practice problem at a pace that's comfortable for you. Take as much time as you need to build each part of the app's functionality. The solution code for the Lemonade app is available at the end, but it's recommended that you try to build the app yourself before you check the solution. Remember that the provided solution is not the only way to build the Lemonade app, so it's completely valid to build it a different way as long as the app requirements are met.
